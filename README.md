; For each widget, the program finds difference between the size measured and the target ; size. 

; If each widget that is less than 92% of the target size it will be rejected. 

; Any widgets that are larger than 108% of the target size will need to be reworked. 
; Otherwise, it is acceptable. 

; Each widget is pulled from an array and is determined 
; if it is to be rejected,reworked, or accepted and store 
; the value in the widget status array. -1 for rejected, 0 for accepted, 1 for rework.
